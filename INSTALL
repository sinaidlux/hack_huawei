REQUIREMENTS
------------

OpenSSL >= 0.9.6


INSTALLATION
------------

./configure [--prefix=<prefix>]
make
make install

Pretty simple.  Just so you know, it isn't GNU autoconf so it won't take for
ever to do the 'configure' part.  You can seed the following options into
the configure script:

	Variable	Function
	--------	------------------------------------------------
	CC		Defines which C compiler to use
	CFLAGS		Preconfigure which CFLAGS to use
	LDFLAGS		Preconfigure which LDFLAGS to use
	SSLINCPATH	Specify where to find the OpenSSL headers
	SSLLIBPATH	Specify where to find the OpenSSL libraries
 
For example:

  $ CC="/usr/home/me/.secret-stash/bin/the-good-gcc" ./configure

That should be enough because there is no more.  It is smart enough to figure
most things out by itself.  But not always.


SYSTEM SPECIFIC
---------------

o Solaris - 64bit
  SPARC64 Linux

If you are using a GCC >= 3.2, you can build this program 64-bit (so as long as
you have 64-bit OpenSSL libraries).  If you're using Forte, I'll let you figure
out the options for yourself.

The options to use:

  $ LDFLAGS="-m64" CFLAGS="-m64" SSLLIBPATH=/usr/local/ssl/lib/sparcv9 \
    ./configure
