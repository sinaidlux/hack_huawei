DESCRIPTION
-----------

Drop in replacement for md5sum from 'GNU textutils'.  I wanted to install
'md5sum' on my Solaris boxen but didn't want the trauma of installing GNU
textutils... especially when Solaris comes with 95% of those programs in
the first place.

So, here it is.  The culmination of 3 hours of coding, a pot of coffee, 3 
breaks, 2 hours of maintaining my hatred of GNU autoconf, 2 hours of 
documentation, and one Solaris package.  BTW, if you know Ulrich Drepper, 
smack him for me for making me run around in circles to figure out what his 
md5sum was doing with its command line options.


INSTALLATION
------------

Please look at the file 'INSTALL'


USAGE
-----

Efforts were taken to make these programs as compatible as possible to their
counterparts from GNU textutils.  This doesn't mean that they -are- compatible
but most people will not be able to notice the difference.

Here's a dump of 'md5sum --help'

############################################################################
$ md5sum --help
Usage: ./md5sum [<option>] <file> [<file> [...] ]
       ./md5sum [<option>] --check <file>

Note:  These options are mostly compatible with GNU md5sum
       -s, -h, and -V are not available in GNU md5sum

 -b, --binary         Read files in binary mode
 -c, --check <file>   Check MD5 sums from <file>
 -t, --text           Read files in ASCII mode

 -s, --status         Silent mode: Use exit code to determine verification

 -h, --help           Display this help message and exit
 -V, --version        Display program version and exit
############################################################################

Pretty self-explainatory.  If you must have a man page for this program, the
one for 'md5sum' from 'GNU textutils' should suit you fine.  If you -MUST- 
have one specifically for this program, feel free to write it up and send it 
to me. :^p


REPORTING BUGS
--------------

As an interlude:  It is funny how visually and conceptually similar 
'reposting bugs' and 'reporting bugs' are.  Chew on that for a bit.

And oh, yeah... You can email me the bug reports for now.


THANKS IN ORDER
---------------

* Steve Moon for a compile fix which can be found in version 0.9.4.
* Ralf S. Engelschall for a fix which can be found in version 0.9.5.
