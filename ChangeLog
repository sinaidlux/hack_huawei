md5sha1sum 0.9.5
----------------

  size warning.  Thanks to Ralf S. Engelschall for pointing this out to me.

md5sha1sum 0.9.4
----------------
* Changed function arguments to use 'unsigned char *' instead of 'char *'
  in do_md5sum, do_sha1sum, and do_ripemd160sum.  Thanks to Steve Moon for
  pointing this out to me.

md5sha1sum 0.9.3
----------------
* Changes so it doesn't try to get the hash of a directory.
* Added excessively verbose error output.
* Miscellaneous bug squashing.

md5sha1sum 0.9.2
----------------
* The --check <file> option can now use '-' for stdin.
* Added support for OS X in configure to find 'libssl.dylib'

md5sha1sum 0.9.1
----------------
